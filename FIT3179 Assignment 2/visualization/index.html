        <p>This data has been collected from annual, state-wide, <i>Attitudes to School</i> surveys, which measures students
          experiences at school. These are the responses to the question <i>"I have been bullied
          recently at school"</i> from students in year 7 to 9, seperated by Local Government Area (LGA).</p>

        <p>Bullying statistics across Victoria vary greatly, with some correlation to location. In most regions,
          neighbouring LGAs have similar bullying rates and Metropolitan Melbourne has lower rates than in Regional
          Victoria.
          However, in 2016, the LGA with the highest reported rate (30.5%), Northern Grampians near the western border,
          is directly adjacent to the LGA with the lowest rate (Southern Grampians, 4.3%). </p>

        <p><small><i>NAPLAN is a nation-wide standardised test of numeracy and literacy conducted in years 3,5,7 and 9.
              We calculate NAPLAN
              score by aggregating the state governmentâ€™s data on the percentage of students that met or exceeded
              expectations for their year level.
            </i></small></p>

        <p>
          Here, the correlation is more apparent. The LGAs that
          perform better on the NAPLAN tests tend to have less bullying, across all years. This indicates that children
          who
          apply themselves at school and/or environments that value education result in less bullying in class.</p>

          <h2>Trends across Genders</h2>
          <p>One interesting trend is that bullying rates have decreased across the years in all regions and genders. Of
            note
            is that the bullying rate in boys is now 1.9% lower than that in girls, despite starting 2.2% higher. This
            change
            occurred between 2010 and 2011. We speculate that this may be due to the popularisation of social media
            around this
            time, allowing for different avenues of bullying, such as cyberbullying, to emerge. </p>

          <h2>Melbourne Metro Region</h2>
          <p>The Melbourne metropolitan region has generally reported lower bullying rates than across the state,
            despite
            having a range of NAPLAN scores (see above). This may be due to a variety of factors as any factor that
            attracts
            families to the city could be an explanation. Some possible examples are the parents education and
            profession,
            the funding of the school in question, or even the immigration status of students.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within metropolitan Melbourne, KNOX reported the most bullying in 2016 at 22.6%, and Stonnington the least
            at 6%.</p>

          <h2>Decline in Bullying</h2>
          <p>Finally, inspecting the nine most populous LGAs, we find that there has been substantial improvement across
            the years.
            Across all nine LGAs, less than one in five students report having experienced bullying recently, a
            significant improvement. </p>
          <p>
            Melbourne, in particular, has always had low bullying numbers, but has since been joined by Monash; both at
            one student in every eight.
