        <h1>Meteorological and snow indicator in Europe</h1>
        <p>This data has been collected from 2005 to now, the most of the years are the prediction of the data, <i>(Prediction!)</i> , the dataset 
          provides meteorological and snow indicators for Europe only, so that i search for the European map,characterizing operating conditions 
          of winter ski resorts under RCP 4.5 scenario. It includes data on precipitation, snowfall, temperature, and other variables.

        <p>The Map visualisation provides an overview of the area and placement across different countries in Europe. The map uses colour from green to red to represent the latitude of the place
          , with the map placement and different, it's easy to tell the latitude .

          <p>On the map, the majority of places are represented in green, indicating that it's about 1000km high vertically from  is the ground. While small amount of place in Europe are somehow red,
          which indicate it could be on the mountain or highground, as higher place got lower temperature. A combination of a choropleth map and dots shown on the map, it also has a legend on 
          the right side that explains the color-coding.</p>

        <p><small><i>The three graphs can be compared horizontally, as i set the limit of days as the same for all of them, each one indicate low, medium and high snow depth in Europe during 
          the year from 2005 and 2030.
             
            </i></small></p>

        <p>
          There are three different rates of the amount of days due to the number of days: sd_days_low, sd_days_medium, and sd_days_high. These metrics track the number of days with 
          specific minimum snow depths (5 cm, 30 cm, and 50 cm, respectively) on the ground within various time periods, encompassing annual, Christmas, and Purimasa periods from 2005 to 2030.

          The variable sd_days_low, which signifies days with a minimum of 5 cm of snow, shows the frequency of snowfall and its duration throughout the year. 
          A higher count of such days indicate more natural snow cover, which make the ski resort more consistent with snow conditions for their operations.

          What's more, sd_days_medium and sd_days_high, which represent days with minimum snow depths of 30 cm and 50 cm, respectively, offer a much more deeper
          snow cover.

          All the three graphs have a similar overall shape, but the amount of days getting lower and lower.</p>

          <h2>Indicator of Machine-made snow </h2>
          <p>The mm_prod variable in the dataset provides information on the annual amount of machine-made snow produced (in kg m-2) for the period August 1st of year N-1 to July 31st 
            of year N (using managed snow simulations). This variable is relevant to the ski industry as it helps in understanding the amount of snow that can be produced artificially. 
            From the bar graph it shows that from years to years, the machine-made snow stay in a stable rate, which is a way extend the ski season, as resorts can begin operating earlier
             and continue later into the spring. This not only provides more opportunities for skiers but also increase the revenue of ski resorts. It can be a crucial factor for the 
             economic sustainability of these businesses in Europe with short and unpredictable natural snow seasons.
             <p><small><i>Connect to the graph at last : 'temp_vs_natural_snow', it's easy to tell that the period of the natural snow normally only last about one to two month in Europe, due the amount of 
              population and the popular of sking in European countries, it's clearly not enough only depends on the natural snow, machine-snow is an essential factor that support the ski resort and 
              such organization during the time.

          <p>The data can be used to optimize snow production and reduce costs, also the variable can be used to study the impact of climate change and the ski industry.

          <h2>Natural snow in Europe and the temperature</h2>
          <p>This dataset is all about understanding how much snow falls during winter in Europe and how cold it is during those times.

            The "swe_days_natural_high" tells us how many days there's cold during the year time and the "mean_winter_tas" indicate the temperature in celsius as the code transfer Kelvin 
            into Celsius during the time. There are lot's of days that with no natural, which connect to the machine-made snow that mention before.  
            
             </p>
          <p>
            By looking at these two things, how natural snow might be changing the temperature in Europe are shown.
